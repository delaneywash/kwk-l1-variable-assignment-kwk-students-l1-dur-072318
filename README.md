Remember that test failures are normal for unsolved labs! This is how we will be progressing through our material and objectives, writing solutions and solving unsolved concerns until each test gets satisfied. To solve the test failure for this lab, create a local variable `greeting` in the `variable.rb` file. Set `greeting` equal to the string `"Hello World"`. Run `learn` to see if you did this correctly.
